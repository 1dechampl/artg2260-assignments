                        <p2 class="tm-subtitle">Hello! My name is Louis and I was born on the 4th of May 1999. I am half Belgian and half American but I've only ever lived in Belgium. I grew up with an older brother and a younger sister. We all attended the International School of Brussels which was a five-minute walk from our house. I am currently undeclared at Northeastern, although I do have a passion for the sciences in general. My hobbies include: playing music, traveling, winter sports, and graphic design. I play clarinet, saxophone, and I am in the process of learning electric bass. I decided to take this class not only because it is a requirement of my intended major, but also because I am interested to know about what goes into a web page and/or a program that one might find on the internet. I also enjoy graphic design and messing about with tools like photoshop so I figured I might try design using a differend medium.</p2>
